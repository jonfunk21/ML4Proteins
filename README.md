# ML4Proteins
Welcome to **ML4Proteins**! Here you will learn about the concepts and methods of machine learning for protein engineering using [ProteusAI](https://github.com/jonfunk21/ProteusAI).
The course is primarily aimed to newcomers to the field and mostly geared to biotechnology, and bioinformatic students who had some contact with machine learning and Python before.
If you are new to both machine learning and Python, then this course might be challenging at times.
The course material is closely linked to our research and will bring introduce you to bleeding edge research questions we are thinking about on a daily basis. This is our first course 
on the subject matter and we hope to make the course as useful as possible. We want the course to be as useful as possible, so please let us know if we can make improvements!

The exercises are designed in conjunction with the university course [27666 AI-guided Protein Science: From Design to Engineering](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2024-2025/27666?menulanguage=en)
of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but can also be taken without the course material. Some course material will be made available online (links will be shared).

## Getting Started
To get started with the course material, please clone [ProteusAI](https://github.com/jonfunk21/ProteusAI) and follow the installation instructions.
If the installation is successful, you should be able to activate the `proteusAI` environment.

```bash
conda activate proteusAI
```
Verfiy that the environment installed successfully by opening and importing proteusAI in `python`.

```python
import proteusAI as pai
print(pai.__version__)
```
This should print the current `pai` version.

## Next Steps
Once your environment is set up and ready, you can proceed to the course content.

Happy Learning!
