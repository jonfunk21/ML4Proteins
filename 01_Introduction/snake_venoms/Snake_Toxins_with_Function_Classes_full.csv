Releases fibrinopeptide A and B in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, with preferential activity on the alpha chain of fibrinogen (PubMed:26227411, PubMed:34506860). Also hydrolyzes N-p-toluensulfonyl arginine ester (TAME) and chromogenic artificial substrates of the blood coagulation cascade: S-2222 for factor Xa, S-2302 for kallikrein and S-2238 for thrombin (PubMed:26227411). When tested in vitro, the recombinant protein does not degrade blood clots, suggesting that this toxin lacks fibrinolytic activity (PubMed:31131001). In addition, it moderately inhibits human Kv10.1/KCNH1/EAG1 currents, with a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity. It selectively blocks Kv10.1/KCNH1/EAG1 in a time and dose-dependent manner (IC(50)=4.2 uM for native protein and IC(50)=2.5 uM for recombinant protein). It may have a preference in interacting with Kv10.1/KCNH1/EAG1 in its closed state, since the inhibitory effect of the toxin is decreased at more depolarized potentials. Corroboratively, it may have possible antitumor applications, since it reduces the viability of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which strongly expresses Kv10.1/KCNH1/EAG1, but does not affect the liver carcinoma and the non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cell lines, which weakly express Kv10.1/KCNH1/EAG1 (PubMed:32161292). When tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the native protein shows mild cytotoxicity, whereas the recombinant protein does not show any cytotoxicity (PubMed:34506860). Native form is not immununogenic, since it does not induce statistically significant antibody production in mice, whereas recombinant form shows an antibody titer slightly higher than the native form (PubMed:34506860). In vivo, subplantar injection in mice paw induces a discreet paw edema (PubMed:31131001). In addition, intraperitoneal injection of the recombinant protein into mice led to fibrinogen depletion, resulting in the blood incoagulability (PubMed:31131001). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26227411, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31131001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32161292, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34506860}.",Serine Protease

The complex acts by binding to a specific 48-kDa protein (R48) receptor located on presynaptic membranes, forming a transient ternary complex CA-CB-R48, followed by dissociation of the CA-CB complex and release of the CA subunit (By similarity). At equilibrium, only the CB subunits remain associated with the specific crotoxin receptor (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:C0HM14}.; FUNCTION: Monomer CBc: The basic subunit of crotoxin is a snake venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that exhibits weak neurotoxicity (10-fold less than the heterodimer) and very strong anticoagulant effects by binding to factor Xa (F10) and inhibiting the prothrombinase activity (By similarity). In addition, it shows the same effects described for the heterodimer and binds the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR chloride channels and increases the channel current (By similarity).

Inhibits vasopressin binding human V2R in the nanomolar range (Ki=5.02 nM), and also potently inhibits vasopressin-induced cAMP production (IC(50)=94 nM) (PubMed:35122240). In vivo, this protein shows an aquaretic effect (PubMed:28630289, PubMed:35122240). Urine output increases and urine osmolality decreases dramatically under treatment with this protein, without differences observed between healthy mice and the pcy mice model of the autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (PubMed:28630289). This protein does not modify electrolyte, protein and urea excretions in the urine samples, but produces a 3-fold decrease of creatinine levels (PubMed:28630289). Intraperitoneal injection of this protein into the pcy mice significantly reduces the number of renal cysts and the total area of cysts (PubMed:28630289). This protein also shows high efficacy in preventing hyponatremia in rat models (induced by DAVP) (PubMed:33052234). Is highly visible in mice liver and kidney after intravenous injection (PubMed:33052234). Is rapidly eliminated in the liver, whereas it exhibits slow elimination in the kidney due to the high expression of V2R which acts as a reservoir (PubMed:33052234). In addition, its elimination from blood is rapid (PubMed:33052234). Fluorescent MQ1 probes could also be used for imaging V2R-overexpressing cancer cells; note that these probes label the three renal cancer cell lines CAKI-2, ACHN and A498 that highly express V2R (PubMed:33052234). In vivo, does not show any toxicity on animals, even at highest doses tested, such as prostration, spidy coat, appetite or weight loss (PubMed:33052234). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28630289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33052234, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35122240}.",Vascular Interaction

The inhibition of ADP- or arachidonic-acid-induced platelet aggregation may be due to it acting as an antagonist of the ADP receptors or thromboxane-prostanoid receptors of the platelets, respectively. Does not interact with integrins alpha-IIb (ITGA2B) or beta-3 (ITGB3) nor platelet glycoproteins VI (GP6) or IX (GP9) in vitro, however, the detection is dependent on experimental conditions and may happen in vivo.

This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (PubMed:24145104).

The response of indirectly stimulated neuromuscular preparations to ammodytoxin (Atx) is triphasic. The first phase, the transient inhibition of the acetylcholine (ACh) release, starts soon after the addition of Atx and lasts for several minutes. This phase is probably independent of Atx enzymatic activity. The effect may be due to the specific binding of the toxin to presynaptic receptors. These receptors, called N-type receptors, are still unidentified. It is noteworthy that a neuronal isoform of the M-type PLA2 receptor (R180) has been identified as a high-affinity receptor for Atx in neuronal plasma membranes. It was demonstrated however that this receptor is not essential for expression of neurotoxicity by Atx. The second phase corresponds to an augmentation of neurotransmitter release. A peak is reached 10-20 minutes after exposure of the preparation to Atx and is followed by a gradual reduction. In this phase, the enzymatic activity of Atx of the mammalian is not significant. It is speculated that the increased release of neurotransmitter in this phase is induced by the interference of Atx with voltage-gated potassium channels. Measurements of ionic currents showed however that voltage-gated potassium channels are not affected by Atx. The third phase of the response of neuromuscular preparations to Atx, which corresponds to a complete and irreversible paralysis, is clearly dependent on the hydrolytic activity of the toxin. In addition to its presynaptic neurotoxicity, Atx shows an anticoagulant activity by binding with high affinity to activated coagulation factor X (F10) thus inhibiting the formation of the prothrombinase complex (FX/FV) and its activity (IC(50) is 20 nM). Surprisingly, Atx was discovered to bind intracellular proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) (IC(50) is 6 nM), 14-3-3 proteins gamma (YWHAG) and epsilon (YWHAE) (by similarity with AtxC), as well as R25 (by similarity with AtxC), a mitochondrial integral membrane protein found in cerebral cortex. These findings raised a doubt about the dogma of the exclusively extracellular action of PLA2s, defended by the potential instability of these molecules in the reducing environment of the eukaryotic cytosol coupled with their possible inability to act as enzymes in this cellular compartment, due to too low concentration of calcium ions. This hypothesis was challenged efficiently by demonstrating the internalization of AtxA into a culture cells, but still remains to be directly demonstrated in vivo.

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6JK69, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1429612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28633930}.",Phospholipase

CA has no PLA2 activity and is not neurotoxic by itself, but plays several important functions in the crotoxin complex by increasing the lethal potency of the uncomplexed CB subunit. It acts by physically occluding the hydrophobic interfacial binding surface (IBS) of CB (PubMed:21787789). This effect decreases the adsorption of CB to phospholipid membranes, targeting the crotoxin complex to reach the specific presynaptic receptor (R48) at the neuromuscular junction. It also prevents the formation of the reactive CB dimer.

The complex acts by binding to a specific 48-kDa protein (R48/CAPT) receptor located on presynaptic membranes, forming a transient ternary complex CA-CB-R48, followed by dissociation of the CA-CB complex and release of the CA subunit (PubMed:12657321). At equilibrium, only the CB subunits remain associated with the specific crotoxin receptor. In addition to neurotoxicity, crotoxin has been found to exert myotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiovascular toxicity (PubMed:20109480). Moreover, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-tumor and analgesic effects of crotoxin have also been reported (PubMed:20109480). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12657321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20109480}.; FUNCTION: [Crotoxin chain gamma]: Found in the venom as a monomer and stabilized by one disulfide bond (Cys-131 and Cys-138) (PubMed:18495297).

The response of indirectly stimulated neuromuscular preparations to ammodytoxin (Atx) is triphasic. The first phase, the transient inhibition of the acetylcholine (ACh) release, starts soon after the addition of Atx and lasts for several minutes. This phase is probably independent of Atx enzymatic activity. The effect may be due to the specific binding of the toxin to presynaptic receptors. These receptors, called N-type receptors, are still unidentified. It is noteworthy that a neuronal isoform of the M-type PLA2 receptor (R180) has been identified as a high-affinity receptor for Atx in neuronal plasma membranes. It was demonstrated however that this receptor is not essential for expression of neurotoxicity by Atx. The second phase corresponds to an augmentation of neurotransmitter release. A peak is reached 10-20 minutes after exposure of the preparation to Atx and is followed by a gradual reduction. In this phase, the enzymatic activity of Atx of the mammalian is not significant. It is speculated that the increased release of neurotransmitter in this phase is induced by the interference of Atx with voltage-gated potassium channels. Measurements of ionic showed however that voltage-gated potassium channels are not affected by Atx. The third phase of the response of neuromuscular preparations to Atx, which corresponds to a complete and irreversible paralysis, is clearly dependent on the hydrolytic activity of the toxin. In addition to its presynaptic neurotoxicity, Atx shows an anticoagulant activity by binding with high affinity to activated coagulation factor X (F10) thus inhibiting the formation of the prothrombinase complex (FX/FV) and its activity (IC(50) is 240 nM). Surprisingly, Atx was discovered to bind intracellular proteins such as calmodulin (CaM), 14-3-3 proteins gamma (YWHAG) and epsilon (YWHAE), as well as R25, a mitochondrial integral membrane protein found in cerebral cortex. These findings raised a doubt about the dogma of the exclusively extracellular action of PLA2s, defended by the potential instability of these molecules in the reducing environment of the eukaryotic cytosol coupled with their possible inability to act as enzymes in this cellular compartment, due to too low concentration of calcium ions.

The response of indirectly stimulated neuromuscular preparations to ammodytoxin (Atx) is triphasic. The first phase, the transient inhibition of the acetylcholine (ACh) release, starts soon after the addition of Atx and lasts for several minutes. This phase is probably independent of Atx enzymatic activity. The effect may be due to the specific binding of the toxin to presynaptic receptors. These receptors, called N-type receptors, are still unidentified. It is noteworthy that a neuronal isoform of the M-type PLA2 receptor (R180) has been identified as a high-affinity receptor for Atx in neuronal plasma membranes. It was demonstrated however that this receptor is not essential for expression of neurotoxicity by Atx. The second phase corresponds to an augmentation of neurotransmitter release. A peak is reached 10-20 minutes after exposure of the preparation to Atx and is followed by a gradual reduction. In this phase, the enzymatic activity of Atx of the mammalian is not significant. It is speculated that the increased release of neurotransmitter in this phase is induced by the interference of Atx with voltage-gated potassium channels. Measurements of ionic currents showed however that voltage-gated potassium channels are not affected by Atx. The third phase of the response of neuromuscular preparations to Atx, which corresponds to a complete and irreversible paralysis, is clearly dependent on the hydrolytic activity of the toxin. In addition to its presynaptic neurotoxicity, Atx shows an anticoagulant activity by binding with high affinity to activated coagulation factor X (F10) thus inhibiting the formation of the prothrombinase complex (FX/FV) and its activity (IC(50) is 82 nM). Surprisingly, Atx was discovered to bind intracellular proteins such as calmodulin (CaM), 14-3-3 proteins gamma (YWHAG) and epsilon (YWHAE) (by similarity with AtxC), as well as R25 (by similarity with AtxC), a mitochondrial integral membrane protein found in cerebral cortex. These findings raised a doubt about the dogma of the exclusively extracellular action of PLA2s, defended by the potential instability of these molecules in the reducing environment of the eukaryotic cytosol coupled with their possible inability to act as enzymes in this cellular compartment, due to too low concentration of calcium ions. This hypothesis was challenged efficiently by demonstrating the internalization of AtxA into a culture cells, but still remains to be directly demonstrated in vivo (By similarity).

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10653156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11005629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1765075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17927217, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7662700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8835336, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8973554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9514950}.",Phospholipase

At equilibrium, only the CB subunits remain associated with the specific crotoxin receptor. In addition to neurotoxicity, crotoxin has been found to exert myotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiovascular toxicity (PubMed:20109480).

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity).

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9056257}.",Phospholipase

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17270350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17915277, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19463969}.",Phospholipase

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16793192}.",Phospholipase

Cleavage at Arg-320 produces an active intermediate known as meizothrombin (PubMed:23869089). Meizothrombin is the 'second' substrate for prothrombinase, and it docks in an altered manner to present the second cleavage site (271) (PubMed:23869089).

This non-catalytic subunit is functionally similar to blood coagulation factor V (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). It serves as a critical cofactor for the prothrombinase activity of the catalytic subunit, which is similar to the blood coagulation factor X (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). The complex converts prothrombin to thrombin by sequential cleavage at two positions, Arg-320 followed by Arg-271 (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). Cleavage at Arg-320 produces an active intermediate known as meizothrombin (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). Meizothrombin is the 'second' substrate for prothrombinase, and it docks in an altered manner to present the second cleavage site (271) (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). Cleavage at Arg-271 releases active thrombin from its pro-fragment (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). This order of events is reversed if the protease component of prothrombinase is used on its own, suggesting that the 271 site is inherently more accessible to proteolysis (PubMed:3531198, PubMed:6986908). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:3531198, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6986908}.",Miscellaneous

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15225567}.",Phospholipase

This non-catalytic subunit is functionally similar to blood coagulation factor V (PubMed:12362232, PubMed:23869089). It serves as a critical cofactor for the prothrombinase activity of the catalytic subunit, which is similar to the blood coagulation factor X (PubMed:12362232, PubMed:23869089). The complex converts prothrombin to thrombin by sequential cleavage at two positions, Arg-320 followed by Arg-271 (PubMed:23869089). Cleavage at Arg-320 produces an active intermediate known as meizothrombin (PubMed:23869089). Meizothrombin is the 'second' substrate for prothrombinase, and it docks in an altered manner to present the second cleavage site (271) (PubMed:23869089). Cleavage at Arg-271 releases active thrombin from its pro-fragment (PubMed:23869089).

It inhibits the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by a preferential interaction with its C-domain (PubMed:11994001). It evokes transient hypotension (-14 mmHg) similar to that evoked by 0.5 ug of bradykinin, when injected alone into rats. It has a high bradykinin-potentiating effect (120%), when 60 nmol of BPP-10c are coinjected with 0.5 ug of bradykinin into rats (PubMed:22869554). Does not affect angiotensin-1 pressor effects. Shows potent and long-lasting antihypertensive activity as well as a reduction of the heart rate (PubMed:17475904). It also binds and dose-dependently promotes the activation of cytosolic argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrulline, L-aspartate and ATP to argininosuccinate, AMP and pyrophosphate. It also enhances ASS1-dependent arginine production in HEK 293 cells, as well as in spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) and Wistar rat plasma. In addition, it induces the production of nitric-oxide (NO) by HUVEC cells via the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3), which use arginine as a substrate and produce NO. It has been shown to be internalized by ASS1-expressing endothelial (HUVEC) and kidney (HEK 293) cells, and is detected homogenously distributed within the cell cytoplasm for up to 2 hours (PubMed:19491403). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17475904, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19491403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22869554}.; FUNCTION: [Bradykinin-potentiating peptide 11e]: Acts as indirect hypotensive agent.

In addition, it induces NLRP3 NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD), caspase-1 (CASP1), and IL-1beta (IL1B) gene expression in the gastrocnemius muscle, showing that it is able to activate NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:31906173). It also damages artificial and myoblast membranes by a calcium-independent mechanism, has bactericidal activity, and induces neuromuscular blockade (PubMed:27531710). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity) (PubMed:27531710). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity) (PubMed:27531710). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity) (PubMed:27531710). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity) (PubMed:27531710). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity) (PubMed:27531710). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11018293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11829743, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12079495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17346668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18160090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27531710, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3176051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31906173}.",Phospholipase

May act as pro-inflammatory mediators, inducing metalloproteinase and cytokine production from the inflammatory and satellite cells (PubMed:19673103). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10860537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19673103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9972319}.",Phospholipase

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11054123}.",Phospholipase

Shows potent and long-lasting antihypertensive activity as well as a reduction of the heart rate (PubMed:17475904). It also binds and dose-dependently promotes the activation of cytosolic argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrulline, L-aspartate and ATP to argininosuccinate, AMP and pyrophosphate. It also enhances ASS1-dependent arginine production in HEK 293 cells, as well as in spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) and Wistar rat plasma. In addition, it induces the production of nitric-oxide (NO) by HUVEC cells via the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3), which use arginine as a substrate and produce NO. It has been shown to be internalized by ASS1-expressing endothelial (HUVEC) and kidney (HEK 293) cells, and is detected homogenously distributed within the cell cytoplasm for up to 2 hours (PubMed:19491403). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17475904, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19491403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22869554}.; FUNCTION: [Poly-His-poly-Gly peptide 1]: May serve as a metalloproteinase inhibitor during glandular storage.

It acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and as a potent voltage-gated potassium channel inhibitor. It exhibits antimicrobial activities, hind limb paralysis, and severe muscle necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. As a cell-penetrating peptide, crotamine has high specificity for actively proliferating cells, and interacts inside the cell with subcellular and subnuclear structures, like vesicular compartments, chromosomes and centrioles. It penetrates into the cells as fast as five minutes after its addition to cell culture medium (PubMed:18662711). In vivo, after intraperitoneal administration, it is found in cells of peritoneal fluid and bone marrow, demonstrating preferential nuclear and perinuclear localization. To enter the cell, it interacts with the chains of heparan sulfate membrane proteoglycan (HSPG), and is endocytosed (in complex with HSPG) in vesicles which are transported into the cell with the help of clathrin. Inside the cell, crotamine accumulates in lysosomal vesicles. As soon as the peptide accumulates in endosomes/lysosomes vesicles, these compartments are disrupted and their contents released into the cytosol. This loss of lysosomal content induces cell death at high concentrations, or promotes the distribution of crotamine in cytoplasmic compartments, which is a step before crotamine nuclear uptake (PubMed:15231729, PubMed:17491023). As a potassium channel inhibitor, this toxin selectively inhibits Kv1.1/KCNA1, Kv1.2/KCNA2 and Kv1.3/KCNA3 channels with an IC(50) of 369, 386 and 287 nM, respectively (PubMed:22498659). The inhibition of Kv1.3/KCNA channels induced by this toxin occurs rapidly and is voltage-independent. The channel inhibition is reversible after washing, suggesting a pure and classical channel blockage effect, without effects in potassium channel kinetics (PubMed:22498659). As an antimicrobial peptide, crotamine shows antibacterial activity against E.coli and B.subtilis, and antifungal activity against Candida spp., Trichosporon spp. and C.neoformans. It kills bacteria through membrane permeabilization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1176086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15231729, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17491023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17588630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18662711, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19706485, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21386851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22142367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22498659, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23022146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:667499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9839677}.",Kunitz Family

Venom 5'-nucleotidases are also known to synergistically act in vivo with other toxins like ADPases, phospholipases, and disintegrins to exert a more pronounced anti-coagulant effect. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0DJJ5, ECO:0000305|PubMed:20186872}.",Phospholipase

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2029535}.",Phospholipase

Anticoagulation through the removal of fibrinogen from the blood is rapid, occurring within hours following its administration. It does not activate plasminogen and does not degrade preformed, fully cross-linked thrombin fibrin.

The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity).

In normal condition of hemostasis, the cleavage of the Arg41-Ser42 bond liberates a new N-terminus that functions as an agonist. However after envenomation, the cleavage of Arg46-Asn47 bond degrades this potential agonist.

Shows myotoxic activity and edema-inducing activities in vivo (PubMed:10863008). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10863008}.",Phospholipase

This non-catalytic subunit is functionally similar to blood coagulation factor V. It serves as a critical cofactor for the prothrombinase activity of the catalytic subunit, which is similar to the blood coagulation factor X. The complex converts prothrombin to thrombin by sequential cleavage at two positions, Arg-320 followed by Arg-271. Cleavage at Arg-320 produces an active intermediate known as meizothrombin. Meizothrombin is the 'second' substrate for prothrombinase, and it docks in an altered manner to present the second cleavage site (271). Cleavage at Arg-271 releases active thrombin from its pro-fragment. This order of events is reversed if the protease component of prothrombinase is used on its own, suggesting that the 271 site is inherently more accessible to proteolysis. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q7SZN0}.",Miscellaneous

May act by activating the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR2). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22617223}.",General Toxin

It acts as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent proton sensitivity for inactivation. It binds more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a (By similarity). It interacts directly with the outside surface of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert into the acidic pocket as suggested previously (By similarity). This binding leads to relocation of the thumb domain that could disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a (By similarity). The peptide exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on ASIC1a (By similarity). It reversibly inhibits rASIC1a (IC(50)=17 nM), rASIC1b (IC(50)= 44 nM) and rASIC1a-rASIC2a (IC(50)=252 nM) channels (Ref.1). In vivo, it shows a potent naloxone-resistant analgesic effect against acute and inflammatory pain upon central and peripheral injection.

Is myotoxic and displays edema-inducing activities (By similarity). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q90249}.",Phospholipase

Is myotoxic and displays edema-inducing activities (By similarity). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q90249}.",Phospholipase

This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P82287}.",Phospholipase

Is myotoxic and displays edema-inducing activities in mouse paw (By similarity). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity).

Also exerts a weak anticoagulant effect only at concentrations of 40 ug/ml or higher (PubMed:7749580). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7749580}.",Phospholipase
